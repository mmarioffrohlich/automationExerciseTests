# automationExerciseTests
Repository where I'll place all my code used to automate 'Automation exercise' site

So, I've found a nice list of resources to practice testing and I've decided to go through all of them to practice my skills. 
I'll place all code here for all of you to use. 

First site I'll automate is https://www.automationexercise.com/ 

Happy testing
